# E-Learning-Website-
A website that helps students and instructors communicate among each other. The website allows instructors to create courses, manage them, add students to the course, and post all relevant material or announcements online. Students are able to register courses, view available material, and check announcements. The website also provides a discussion form for each course that allows students and instructors to post discussions and allow others to participate in the discussion. A server is implemented to manage the back-end processes (database, interactions, notifications...) and sends notifications for any announcements by the instructor or any new discussions Using Java, PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
